# Hello there! 👋

My name is Martins Meisters and i am a C#/.NET Full-stack software developer ( [see also in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinsmeisters/) )

I am a hardworking, detail-oriented professional with a strong sense of responsibility. I approach tasks with efficiency and maintain an organized work environment. Driven by a passion for personal growth and excellence, I continually strive to deliver high-quality results. With extensive experience in the sales industry, both in retail and e-commerce, I have developed excellent communication skills, enabling me to understand client needs and provide effective solutions. Through self-study, I gained hands-on experience in coding, particularly within the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Express.js), which led to my transition into a professional software development role. Currently, I specialize in .NET development using C# programming language.

## Top Java projects
1️⃣ [Flight planner](https://github.com/mart8ins/flight-planner)  <br>

This is quite large Spring boot application that covers many programming principles. There are two main API`s

* Admin API - creates flight, search flight by id, deletes
* Customer API - search flight by id, search airports, search flights using departure/arrival airports and departure date query  <br>

App is secured with spring security and configured that everyone is authorized to do only what they are supposed to do. App is written in TDD aproach, it has unit testing and also integratons test. Thanks to services interface implementations there is option to switch from  "in-memory" data storage version to "database" version where i use PostgreSQL database. Request validations are also included.  <br>

2️⃣ [String expression calculator](https://github.com/mart8ins/stringExpressionCalculator)  <br>

Given input as mathematical expression in string ( "(2 + 6 * (2 / 2)" ) app calculates result. All mathematical rulles are followed: ( ) -> * -> / -> adding/substracting from left to right.  <br>

3️⃣ [Sudoku validator](https://github.com/mart8ins/sudokuValidator)  <br>

This project was interesting expierance to work with external files and deal with text data, in this case sudoku game drawings. App reads files with sudoku game and checks if this game is valid regardless if its completed or not. It validates game in all possible ways. It checks main rows, columns, diognals and also checks subgroups. After validation is done app prints if sudoku game is valid or invalid.  <br>
