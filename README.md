# Hello there! üëã

I am a hardworking, detail-oriented professional with a strong sense of responsibility. I approach tasks with efficiency and maintain an organized work environment. Driven by a passion for personal growth and excellence, I continually strive to deliver high-quality results. With extensive experience in the sales industry, both in retail and e-commerce, I have developed excellent communication skills, enabling me to understand client needs and provide effective solutions. Through self-study, I gained hands-on experience in coding, particularly within the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Express.js), which led to my transition into a professional software development role. Currently, I specialize in .NET development using C# programming language.
